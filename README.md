# Types-of-Software-Testing

Assignment 2: Types of Software Testing

1. Functional vs. Non-Functional Testing

Functional Testing focuses on verifying that the software behaves according to specified requirements. It answers the question: "Does it do what it's supposed to do?" Common types include:

Unit Testing

Integration Testing

System Testing

Acceptance Testing

Non-Functional Testing evaluates aspects like performance, usability, reliability, and security. It answers the question: "How well does the system perform?" Common types include:

Performance Testing

Load Testing

Security Testing

Usability Testing

2. Unit Testing vs. Integration Testing

Unit Testing focuses on individual components or functions of the software in isolation. It ensures that each part of the code works correctly. Example tools: JUnit, NUnit.

Integration Testing verifies how different components or modules work together. It checks for interface defects and data flow between units. Common techniques include Big Bang, Top-Down, and Bottom-Up testing.

3. System Testing and Acceptance Testing

System Testing is a high-level test that checks the complete and integrated software system against the defined requirements. It includes functional and non-functional aspects and is typically done by a QA team.

Acceptance Testing is conducted to determine if the system meets business requirements and is ready for delivery. It's often the final step before release and may involve:

Alpha Testing (by internal staff)

Beta Testing (by selected external users)

4. Types of Non-Functional Testing and Their Importance

Performance Testing: Evaluates how the system behaves under workload.

Load Testing: Checks system response under expected user load.

Stress Testing: Assesses system stability under extreme conditions.

Security Testing: Identifies vulnerabilities and protects data.

Usability Testing: Ensures the product is user-friendly and intuitive.

These tests ensure the software not only functions correctly but also provides a positive user experience, remains secure, and performs reliably in real-world conditions.

Conclusion

Understanding different types of software testing equips developers and testers to deliver high-quality, reliable software. Functional testing ensures the software does what itâ€™s supposed to do, while non-functional testing ensures it does so efficiently, securely, and enjoyably. Mastering both areas is key to building robust digital solutions.
